I'm currently a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science from Stevens Institute of Technology. Prior to joining the Stevens faculty, I obtained my Ph.D from the Department of Statistics at UCLA, where I worked closely with [Dr. Ying Nian Wu](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~ywu/) and [Dr. Song-Chun Zhu](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~sczhu/). From 2010-2013, I obtained a Master of Philosophy (M.Phil.) in computer science at HKUST, working with [Dr. Chiew-lan Tai](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~taicl/) and [Dr. Long Quan](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~quan/).

**Research interest:** generative modeling, un-/semi-supervised learning, representation learning, and relevant applications in computer vision and natural language. *Interested in collaboration? Contact me.*
